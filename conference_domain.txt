An organizing committee is composed by committee members and is responsible for organizing the conference.
The presiding member of the organizing committee is the chair, who publishes the conference.
Authors submit papers, which are received by committee members and distributed by them among reviewers.
Reviewers conduct reviews and recommend which papers should be accepted.
A paper can have three different stages during its lifecycle.
Before reviews a paper is marked as a not evaluated paper.
Once revisions are done, a paper becomes either an accepted paper or a rejected paper.
Presentations are prepared based on accepted papers only.
